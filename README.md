NashPhase API is a simple endpoint that returns back a freshly scraped (once an hour) JSON with Nashville's current reopening phase including the breakdown of all the current restrictions. 

I built this API after I noticed that there is no easy way to get this information programmatically, and also I looked for an excuse to teach myself some AWS technologies.
